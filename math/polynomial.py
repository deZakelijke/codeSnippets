# Made by Micha de Groot
# linked list for a single variable polynomial for complex numbers

# each node contains a degree-coefficient pair
# save in descending order

# to add two polynomials simply add the coefficients of the nodes with the same degree
# to multiply two polynomials store the product of two coefficients in node with
# degree equal to the sum of the two nodes

# solve for value?
# start with only quadratic functions

# operations needed:
# init
class Polynomial(object):
    # head node of linked list

# evaluate
# add two polynomials
# multiply two polynomials
# solve for value
